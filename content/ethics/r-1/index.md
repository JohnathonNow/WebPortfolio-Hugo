My name is John Effrey. Or something like that. Whatever.

This site has an [about](https://johnwesthoff.com/about/) page, so I'm not really sure why I have to write another introduction.
It's worse because I have to do this twice. At least, I think I do. Pbui hasn't put up the video game history reading00 yet.
Assuming it is the same, I'm just going to copy this post there too.

I am interested in stuff. I also have other interests in things. I have a number of hobbies. 

Wait, does this post also have to be ~500 words? Fine, I'll take it more seriously. I guess I am interested in video games. I made
sure to have a four day weekend so that I can drink and play Mario Kart more days than I have to go to class. I am studying
Computer Science because my sisters wouldn't let me be a doctor and instead wanted me to be an engineer like their husbands,
but jokes on them bc imma get a PhD in Computer Science. At least, that's what I want to do. So far I haven't gotten into any grad
schools, but that may be because my applications aren't technically finished.

Shoot, this next part might be different for Ethics and History of Computing. Hmm...

I think bias in software is a serious issue. For example, lots of machine translation programs use real world documents written
in two different languages to train on. But in the real world, people are racists and bigots. So when you use Google Translate
and try to translate `John is a nurse.` from English to Spanish, it assumes my gender and translates that as `John es una enfermera.`
That is, it assumes that `John` is female because he is a nurse. There are much worse examples of software being biased, including
software written for deciding things like parole for prisoners being actually racist. 

Another big issue is the NSA spying on me all the time. Personally, I'm against that. Yet I was foolish enough to work on
[such a system myself](https://github.com/AndrewLitteken/toxbot). We wanted to change that software to detect if someone is
suicidal, but maybe they don't want their internet chats to be recorded. Mass advertising is bad too. This one time, a friend tricked
me into writing [code for embedding subliminal ads inside songs](https://johnwesthoff.com/projects/firstaudacityplugin/). Company
AI have invaded our homes, and now my dad is convinced that the pencil sharpener is listening to him.

I would like to discuss the issues that I am interested in, duh. Oh, I forgot that I wanted to make this post double count for History
of Computing. Well, the fact is, this post is actually about ethics in gaming journalism. Yeah.

I hope to get some hot takes from Vector Bill out of this class. I'd also like to use the class as an excuse to drink <s>vodka</s> beer
and discuss ethics with my friends. Err, for Video game history class, it's to play mario kart with my friends while drinking. 

I really hope these blog posts aren't turned into ABET for ND's recertification, that would be embarassing.
