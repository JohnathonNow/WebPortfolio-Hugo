I hate advertising. All of it. My university seminar was about how ads try to manipulate our brains in order for us to be more inclined to do things. It upsets me that today
subliminal ads aren't the thing to worry about, but really specifically targeted ads that use all of our data to try to appeal to us. There are plenty of issues with this sort
of thing, especially relating to privacy, including how transparent the companies are about what they are collecting, as well as how safely they store it and how willingly
they share it with the governments (such as in the GPL article). My family freaks out whenever facebook suggests them something super specific, and then they expect me to calm
them down. I hate how I can check haveibeenpwned and see that companies accidentally leaked the information they were collecting on me, which bothers me as much as the fact
that they are collecting it to begin with.

I think it can be ethical for companies to take our information and datamine it, but it may be very hard to do so. First, I think they need to disclose fully what they are collecting.
In fact, I would think they should have to show us EXACTLY what they have on us (and one of the articles said we're one of a few countries that doesn't have that. ugh.), though
that bit is a little iffy because of the concern of accidentally leaking the information - which is my next point. They can't ever let other people get your information, any of it.
We have FERPA and HIPAA and all those other things. We need a SOMETHING-A for big data companies. Also, I think it would be most ethical for them to completely anonomize your information,
but it seems that might not be possible as they could infer whose information it was by collecting information, plus they need to at least briefly know which account the data belongs
to for when they update it, so maybe that bit is a pipe dream, but I still think it should be entirely impossible for anyone at Google to even have a chance of saying "I wonder what
Jeffrey has been doing on the internet lately." And the use of it for finding "intelligence" and the like seems especially dangerous. What happens when companies start saying, "Oh,
well, facebook said you're not very smart because you liked these pages, so we can't hire you." Or the government says "We bought some info from Google, and they seem to think
that you might become a terrorist when you turn 35." - Things like this are why the data needs to be at least mostly anonymous, even to the company collecting the data.

I also think I should be able to just TELL these companies what I want. I guess that was the "and sometimes modify it" bit that some countries allow for when taking your info.
Google doesn't know me well at all, or at least, it doesn't know my tastes in YouTube videos. It seems to have defaulted to showing me Linus Tech Tips and Nostalgia Critic episodes,
but only ones I've seen within the past week. Literally nothing in the "Trending" column is anything I would ever watch. It recommended me a channel I spent all day yesterday watching.
That's some brilliant mining right there. "New Music This Week" is definitely something I would be interested in, as most of the songs I listen to on YouTube are decades old. Like,
geeze, I think it would be really easy to recommend channels for me. I've only seen one site do targeted ads well to me, and it was Hackaday.com, and I'm not even sure they were
targeted towards me or just the type of person who would be visiting hackaday.com. I've also told YouTube a dozen times to stop showing me ads for cell carriers. I hate them all.
And why show me a Verizon ad when I am watching from a Verizon phone that runs android so you should totally know it is a Verizon phone, Google?

Privacy is definitely becoming hard, especially since the internet is owned by companies that want your data. So, yes, I definitely think the only move is not to play.
While I do think leaking almost nothing from a PC is potentially doable, cell phones are too useful, and by their very nature they give too much away. Whoever my phone carrier is
KNOWS WHERE I AM at all times, even without GPS (because they need to, for legal reasons relating to emergeancy response), as well as what my texts say and whatnot. I guess I could
use an end-to-end encrypted chat app, but it is hard to get everyone to do that, and I don't trust that my phone company won't find a way to block them anyway. Plus, credit cards
track me, too. I don't want to carry around cash, that's how you get mugged. And then there is EZ Pass, but even that isn't needed when every intersection gets a camera that sees
where I am. I don't doubt at all that in the year 2023 researches at Michigan will make an app that tells what you are typing on your computer from your phone microphone, and then the
very next year google will use it for advertising. Beyond vastly improved privacy laws, I think we've already lost.

I find all advertising intolerable. I even avoid movie trailers and the like - ads exist only to manipulate, so I see no sense in giving them any attention, even subconciously. So
on my computers I currently use FireFox with uBlock Origin, which blocks just about everything that would upset me. Of course, some crafty YouTubers started getting sponsorships
and then put the ads in their videos themselves, but I can just skip them by hand. On my phone, I use the Brave browser, which does a good job at blocking ads and trackers and cookies,
and also offers things like blocking JavaScript and fingerprinting methods, which is pretty neat. It also claims it's saved an hour of my life by blocking 103,000 trackers and 33,000
ads. Part of me doesn't think it is ethical at all to use these tools. Companies do deserve compensation for what they do. But the web is now hostile towards users.
That said, there is a lot into these sorts of things:

They are publically serving content. They only expect my browser to render the ads. In this sense, it isn't really unethical to block the ads. We are requesting a resource from them,
and they are including more than we want in the response. I don't think it is unethical to ignore part of what someone is saying in a conversation. Oh boo woo, The Awl, you might
lost 75%-85% of your ad revenue? Adapt or die. ("Ethicists don’t have much compassion here either, and argue that readers aren’t ethically obligated to support business models that can’t sustain themselves.")
I would be shocked if there was literally no other way for your site to survive. Or maybe it doesn't deserve to. It certainly doesn't need to. I am hosting this blog, aren't I? I
don't get paid for it. If the bandwidth was too much, I would shut it down, and people would have to go to archive.org or something. Or I might move from a vps to my own server.
Either way, you can't expect people to give you money for your services unless they agree to beforehand.

On the other hand, I f-wording hate the stupid pages that ask me to turn off my adblocker. Some that do in very non-invasively, like smbc and hackaday, which both just made posts once
asking people to turn off the blockers, I complied with. Sites like forbes make my blood boil, but I guess it really shouldn't. I should be more mad at the people who linked me to
a forbes article, because counter adblockers seem fair, and negate my "you are publically serving this content" argument.

"Even worse, every time you use one of these services, you're enabling an extortion racket where ad-blocking companies charge content providers money to let their ads through the filter."
Yes I am sure my free and open source ad blocker service is in touch with content providers. Lying is unethical, I know that for sure.
