I haven't had too much experience with the interview process - I've only had three interviews total ever (two for grad schools, one for an internship),
so I'm probably not very qualified for talking about what's important. I think doing your homework about where you applied is important, so you don't
apply to things incorrectly, and so that during your interview you can ask lots of questions, which I am told "shows interest", and makes them more likely
to hire you for some reason.

I wish I knew what I wanted to do earlier - I wasn't really set on the whole grad school thing until after the summer before senior year. If I had known
earlier, I could have focused on building a good resume for schools, rather than an OK one for jobs like I have now. I also think knowing things in the
past isn't the key take away - having done things in the past is. For grad school, having published would have helped me, I think. For industry, I think
it is important to work on cool side projects as well as tech interview questions.

Another important part of our guide, that Shabadoo mentioned, is to sell yourself. Former Chair of the Department, Prof. Bowyer, once told me to open a
conversation with something cool that you've done. I think it can be a very good way to make yourself memorable to your interviewers. That's probably
the best advice I've heard.

I'm pretty torn about the role of CS programs in preparing students for the interview process. On the one hand, it seems to be really important
to prepare for jobs in order to get them. On the other hand, the skills to do well in interviews will be used for literally HOURS of my entire
life. Classes cost ~$100 an hour or something here, I would be pretty annoyed if we had a whole course (either split among multiple actual
courses or as a single dedicated one) as that would be ~$5,000, all to prepare me for talking to a few people for ~40 hours or so in my entire life.

Instead, I think I would rather the department provide more resources for students to do on their own. Perhaps the department could send out emails
to each class once every two weeks or so to keep them on track. These emails could include sample interview questions and problems, and perhaps checklists
for what students should have done by that point. For example, a week one sophomore year email could recommend they start researching companies, and
perhaps give a list that are known to give internships to rising juniors, or maybe it could recommend they start writing a resume, and provide resources
for that. Maybe a slightly later one could just explain whiteboard problems, and perhaps have a video of a professor walking through something like
FizzBuzz on it.
Other than that, we do have mock interviews and resume checks and resources like that, so not a whole lot there would need to be changed
at all.
