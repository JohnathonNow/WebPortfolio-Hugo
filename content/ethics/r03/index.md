I definitely feel that I miss out on things. I'm definitely a big nerd, and I spend a lot of
time on school work, but I also spend a lot of time tinkering with things. I feel a lot of
guilt over living 11 hours from home, and definitely feel like I'm missing a lot with my family.
I have a nephew and four nieces. I think only my oldest niece remembers my name, and my
youngest niece is defintely afraid of me. I have a thirteen-year-old brother who I regret
spending almost no time with. I know people who call home every day. I call home maybe once
a month. 

I don't think this lack of balance has to be all bad, however. Most of my free time in high school
was spent working with my school's robotics team. My dad was an important mentor for the team,
and spent almost as much time as I did there. Now that my brother is old enough to be on the team,
they both re-joined, and I got a dozen texts from my dad today asking for advice on what sensors
to use for a mechanical climbing device. Whenever I go home we easily spend dozens of hours talking
about what the team should be focusing on, among other things. I guess my point is that it is
possible to go all out with something and still have some semblance of balance.

I don't think (oh geeze I started two paragraphs in a row like that, oh well) companies are
obligated to help provide any sort of balance, either. However, I do think they should make it
clear what their intentions are. I don't think a company should claim to be "family friendly" to its
employees and not offer BOTH maternity and paternity leave. Some people do prefer going all out
with their careers. It's fine to do that, and it's fine not to do that. If you want to have a
family, that is fine, but you should make sure that you are working somewhere that will allow
you to do that. If you want to work yourself to death, that's fine too, but you should do that
where doing so won't make other people uncomfortable.

I do think it is possible to "have it all", within reason. Certainly, you could form a startup
with your wife, become a billionare overnight, and then do whatever. That is *possible*.
In general, I think it might be hard to pull in $200k total for the household while also spending
time with your wife and kids, taking ample vacation time, etc., but I think that might be more
than "having it all". I think you can live a fulfilling life, earn a respectable wage, and have
a good home life, too. 

I'm not sure how important this balance is to me career-wise. I chose the career path I chose
partly because I like to explore things in my free time, and I'm hoping that I can be paid to do
that in a sense. I'm not sure if that will make me more balanced, since I can then not tinker in
my free time, or more unbalanced, as then I'll work during my free time. I don't really care
either way. I am trying to be more balanced, and I chose to be no more than four hours from home
for the next six years (I have driven to and from the school I applied to that is farthest from home
a few times now, I think I can come home a few weekends a month and spend time with my family), but
I plan on being a grad student, I plan on working a lot. I'd say my biggest factor on choosing
job is based off doing something new fairly often - I can't imagine being on the same project
for *years*, so I am avoiding that.
