Engineers are snobs, who created a [regulatory industry to stifle competition](https://hackaday.com/2017/05/08/the-dangers-of-engineering-while-unlicensed/comment-page-2/).
When "real engineers" feel threatened by how they are being disrupted in every industry, they
attack the tech industry by saying programming is not engineering. 
Sure, software systems have vulnerabilities, but the ones that are engineered well
usually only fail during attacks. Maybe buildings and bridges would fail more often if people
were constantly trying to break them. Maybe civil engineers aren't real engineers because they
let banks get robbed. I do think Mr. Bogost is right though - programmers should build things
in service of the world, but I think that's more of a corporate problem, as I'm sure lots
of "engineers" have built things in service of taking things over (it may be untrue, but I once
heard that Ford had workers search for old cars in junkyards to see which parts still worked -
not to improve the faster failing parts, but to make the longer lasting parts fail sooner
so that they could save money, that's definitely in collaboration with the world).

I feel that programming and
software engineering are very much a form of engineering.
While I like that `Bridges, Software Engineering, and God` article, I disagree that traditional
engineering insights aren't applicable. The laws of physics may govern all about mechanical
engineering, but they had to discover those rules that some supreme being arbitrarily decided
was a good idea in ~3000BC. SE is a younger field, and I think as it matures the more traditional
engineering disciplines will be more helpful for SE.

But this does not mean that I think
Computer Science is an engineering field. I've heard a lot of classmates complain about
Theory of Computing (a class I am TAing), saying that they won't do that sort of thing in the real
world. And they're right. But they're still CS students, so they have to take Theory. Anyways,
much of the field has its roots in mathematics. Some guy had a <s>drinking</s> "decision" problem
called `Entscheidungsproblem`, and then some guy drew some squiggles that make no sense and some
other guy said that computers are just people too, and then computer science was born. It was born
to solve a problem in mathematics concerned with whether a statement is valid given a set of axioms,
not to actually do anything like software engineers like. (Though there were computery things
before then, but all mechanical monsters that are much more feats of MechE-ism than CS-ism.)
So it seems that CS, which is largely concerned about what we can compute, should be a form of
mathematics. But my classmates have a point, people usually use "computer science" to refer to
software development, and many (most) enter the field to write code. It seems then that I would
be wrong to say that CS is just a branch of mathematics.

Since I'm also in Video Game History, I feel as though I should mention video games. Lots of game
developers are CS majors, and many schools offer game developer tracks as part of their CS programs.
Some video games are engineered - there is no heart behind them, and they are carefully designed
to make CEOs a lot of money. But lots of games are very expressive, and so I believe that
video games are an art form (at least as much as film is, if not more). So, it seems that since
CS is heavily involved in the creation of artwork it should count as an art too. Additionally,
code can have subjective beauty. Someone made a stupid awesome [fluid simulator](https://hackaday.com/2015/03/07/animated-ascii-fluid-dynamics-simulator-is-retro-cool/),
and someone else made a [128 language quine](https://github.com/mame/quine-relay)
both of these are wonderful art pieces, created by true masters of their craft.
I hold the same objection to CS being art that I hold with it being engineering, however.
The study of CS is not limited to how it is used, whether for the creation of software or the
creation of art.

CS, then, to me seems to be like [Dendrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrology), the study
of wooded plants. I won't explain why, because I think it is obvious.

Anyways, I think CS as a field is a clunky mess of artists, engineers, scientists, mathematicians,
good professors, professors who called me bad at age of empires ii, nerds, whiney students, 
and pretentious students. This causes CS programs to force the theory buffs to take software
engineering courses, software engineers to learn their maths in theory classes, artists to
resent both, and professors to wonder why we're ABET certified at all. Personally, I would
split the major, into either its own school of computing or into both `Arts and Letters` and
`Engineering`. Then we could have `Computer Science`, which is all theory and math,
`Software Engineering`, which is in the school of engineering and includes ethics so I could take
a different class instead of this one, and `Game Design`, which is arts. They would have some course
overlap (everyone takes fndcmp1, etc.), but they can be more specialized and distinct.
