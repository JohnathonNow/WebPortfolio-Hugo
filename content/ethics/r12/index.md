The motivation for developing and building self-driving cars is the same motive for everything everyone does, money. I mean, according to that one article, the
Ford CEO even said "we believe that investing in Argo AI will create significant value for our shareholders". And he's totally right. The company that wins the
AI wars will [win at everything forever](https://youtu.be/t-3qncy5Qfk?t=1m31s). I was once told "Money isn't everything, it's the only thing." It's why Uber is a thing.
Oh, and Uber is apparently doing it because money. They said in the Bloomberg article that it is existential for them. For a company, not existing means not having
money. At least, that's what I learned in Prof. Bowyer's class - a company only ever dies because it ran out of money.

Self driving cars can have great benefits to society if done well. For one, they might be able to be safer. Humans suck at driving. Over three THOUSAND people die
each DAY because of automobile accidents. Guns kill roughly a third of what cars do. I say ban them both, as well as beds and bathtubs. It seems likely that cars will
always kill people some of the time, but I am willing to bet we can get car deaths in the US to be lower than gun deaths in the US. Additionally, if we outlaw
non self-driving cars, then we could theoretically have less traffic and have shorter transit times, as things like stop signs become mostly useless (according to the NYT
article). Speed limits on
highways could be raised. And if all of the self driving cars are electric, or at least hybrid, then we can cut down on polution. Additionally, cars today tend to be
a barrier to entry for jobs, especially among the poor. With self driving cars, it is entirely plausible that they become like taxis, and you don't own the car, you
can just hitch a ride. And because there are no drivers, they can cut down on costs, making it cheaper than taxis or man powered Uber. And cities could subsidize it for
workers. Win win win. 

I guess self driving cars freak people out. That's bad. They'll also cost a lot, and provide an even bigger barrier to car ownership, which is both good and bad. I guess
people will worry about them being hacked. That's silly. In this class I'm pretty sure we already watched a regular car get hacked.

In lieu of addressing the social dilemma, please consider the following webcomic from the great

To ask what programmers should do about the ethical dilemma is easy.
Obviously, they should do exactly what their employers, and the law, says that self driving cars should do in a given scenario.
Entirely pass on that responsibility - they're programmers, not policy makers. Maybe throw in some of that asimov nonsense and have three simple laws.

But to ask what a self driving car SHOULD do, well, that's hard. In an ideal world, they should become smart enough, and engineered well enough, to never have to
decide who lives and who dies. It seems like they would be unable to judge well enough what the best case scenario is. Honestly, we should probably just
go with a consistent policy and forget about it. Perhaps "protect the outside world at all costs." That way, if the passengers die, no one has to be held responsible,
and no one is alive to sue.

When an accident does happen, I imagine the police will get involved as usual. If they [deem the victim responsible](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/video-shows-woman-stepped-suddenly-in-front-of-self-driving-uber) that is fine. (And honestly, that dash cam footage is super misleading and I hate everyone
involved - the wired article is right, the sensors totally should have seen the person, and Uber is totally at fault - who cares that a HUMAN couldn't have seen
the woman coming?) But in the case where the self driving car clearly erred, I say we really neeed to look hard into the situation. Did a human do something
to cause it to malfunction? Could they have known what their actions would cause? We should then look into if the action would happen again, and if so, then we
can clearly hold the manufacturer responsible, or at least, force them to fix it.

I touched a little on the impacts already, but basically, they might be able to help the transportation situation in america by providing a cheap, safe, and
quick method of getting around. This could lead to the population distribution of metropolitan areas changing greatly. It could also lead to transportation costs
increasing due to the increased vehicle costs. I guess insurrance rates would go down, because you won't be crashing your car. Politically, we could have self driving
voting vans. That'll be cool. Maybe China will hack our self driving cars and use them as a means of warfare. Wait. Danger. What happens when nation actors
assassinate dissidents using self driving cars? Oh geeze. Also I demand the software be open source, k thanks bye.

The government should regulate the self driving cars the same way regular cars are regulated. Force all human drivers off the road, and pass laws forcing compatibility
between manufacturers, emissions limits, and required behaviours for different scenarios. I think the government should adopt them as public transit, with low subsidized
rates, and do bidding wars for manufacturers. Any nonsense about having cars move slowly is silly. Speed always wins.

I would not want to own a self driving car, as I think that limits their uses. I want them to be utilities. Then I don't have to worry about getting locked out of my
car. Anyways, I would totally use a self driving car. Then I can live north of NYU and read books while I speed into work. Or I can play RuneScape. I also fear death,
so self driving cars will help with that a little. Now I just have to worry about cancer and heart disease.
