Those of you who've known me well over the past few years may have noticed that you've never heard me swear.
It's just something I've never been comfortable doing - there are many situations in which I would like to, but
I find that if I try, some force stops me. But this Net Neutrality issue... There are a lot of things
I would like to say to the likes of Comcast and AT&T. So, I've asked my good friend, The Really Angry One,
Shabadoo, to take my weak words and sprinkle on some sentence enhancers. He'll do that later, so for now
please enjoy the clean version of my rant.

Net Neutrality just makes sense. Because one of you graders said I should reference the artiles more, the
wired one says that net neutrality is basically that the ISPs aren't allowed to control the pipes that
my tax money paid for. That's the way it *curseword-ing* should be. Some stupid-*curseword* companies did
stupid-*cureseword* things like banning customers from using Wi-Fi routers. Are you *curseword-ing* kidding
me? Who the *curseword* thought that was a good idea? And who the *curseword* thinks *curseword* like that 
that is still a good idea? 

I hear arguments against Net Neutrality. Some aim for the republican in me to fight against overreach of
government in industries. But the tech-person-thing in me says "the ISPs hate innovation and are using
the government against me and the other consumers." - those *curseword-ers* used the government to make
it impossible for actual competitors to arrise. They want it both ways. Other arguments, like that one from
the TLD ending in gr, whatever the *curseword* that is, say things like, "Oh, Google just doesn't want to
reduce their digital footprint." - How the *curseword* is someone's motive important in an argument? Talking
about what the ISPs will have to do because of Netflix is silly, because we gave them money to improve
infrastructure, and they *curseword-ing* wasted it, because we'll have to give them more money to
do what we *curseword-ing* gave them the money for in the first place. Last time I said we should
execute Sony, well, AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, and all the other ISPs need to go to *curseword* too.

A lot of arguments for Net Neutrality center on choice of provider, you know, something important for a free
market (I'd say tampering with laws is another thing important in a free market, but whatever). The Verge
discusses how the broadband market isn't competitive, which makes sense, because after the AT&T hackathon,
where they didn't even pay me and just basically gave me an ad for themselves, they told us that Verizon
was their biggest customer, and that they're basically family. Great. Bell only gave us two good things, C and
UNIX, Verizon and AT&T can merge into a blackhole for all I care. People also hate how ISPs are not the
internet, they do not make the content we want. They want to regulate the internet to make their content
unfairly accessible - that is what is truly at stake, and what will truly hurt innovation. Your video service
can be the best in the world, but who cares when AT&T gives you 10KB/s and a 100MB cap on mobile, when they
can use their own service at 1GB/s with no cap even on mobile. I know that's a bit of a stretch, but it will
happen. And what the *curseword* is with Comcast putting data caps on broadband? Are you joking?

I will not discuss where I stand on it, because that should be clear. I also technically didn't put
any of the other answers in my own words either, so basically I haven't done any of the assignment so far.
Oh well.

If I got to enforce net neutrality, what a world it would be. First off, I would condense Verizon, Comcast,
and AT&T into a *curseword-ing* furnace, strip them of all their money, and make a nation wide mesh network.
Bang, now everything is decentralized, so there can be no corporations or governments messing with our
*curseword*. All traffic is equal, or if a node tries to restrict traffic, that node is routed around.
I guess companies could try to buy nodes. Make that *curseword* illegal, with corporate death as the
penalty. Or make it legal to shoot anyone who owns more than six nodes.

Burdening corporations? They chose to be ISPs. The internet is something everybody needs, it's too much
of an advantage for any company to have any control over. It's like oil or the trains, but more versatile.
I agree that regulating companies are bad, but they brought this upon themselves by trying to regulate
out competition. They have made an enemy of me, and for that, I will rain fire upon them, and my wrath
shall bring them down to the depths of *curseword*. 

This can only help innovation. You want to win over customers? Make faster internet, don't *cursewording* charge
me more for what I was already *cursewording* paying for, give me *cursewording* more, you *curseword*. In the
mesh networking scenario, make me a better network node, and sell them to me. Oooh, can I demand all this stuff
be open source and open hardware? Anyways, NN helps startups, which is good. Industries that don't
adapt should die. Only the toughest survive, that's the Briggs way.

I guess I already mentioned that I think the internet should be considered a right, both for the benefit
of individuals (when looking for information, it is priceless), and corporations (when getting customers
and managing your business and literally all the other things, it is priceless). As for free market
or regulation, my answer is both. I think both can be made to work. If we have a totally free market, the
theory is that what's best will win out. But that doesn't work when lobbyists abuse the system to win out.
Regulation can win too, but you do risk overregulation, and the government is basically a company too, and even
with regulation you are still likely to have companies abuse the regulations to hurt competitors.

I'm sure what I wrote counts as tame by some standards, especially since I only ever wrote the phrase "curseword"
in between asterisks, but that still made me feel really bad. I'm going to bed now. Bye...
