What frustrates me about interviews? Whiteboards.

In fact, whiteboarding is so scary to me, that I
took the first offer I got for my Junior Year internship without even applying anywhere else,
and then decided to go to grad school to avoid ever really having to solve problems
on a whiteboard.

I think it is a complete waste of time to have to learn a new skill in order
to get a job. What does that measure? Subservience? I'm not about that.
So, to prepare for interviews, I learn about where I am applying. But I don't bother practicing
questions. I think my past work should speak for itself. 

It seems strange to me that the "Why can't Programmers.. Program?" article wrote,
"It's a shame you have to do so much pre-screening to have the luxury of interviewing programmers 
who can actually program." as I think it's a shame programmers have to go through so much
nonsense in order to get a job to have food to live. Tech companies are big. They can afford
to either find a better way to hire or accept that a qualified person might be a bad hire.

Really nothing about the interview process excites me. It all gives me stress, and shortens my life
span. The thoughts of "if I say anything wrong here, the whole course of my life could change"
overwhelm me. I hate it. It feels like I am taking a test. I hate tests. I went out of my way
to schedule classes to minimize tests for my last three semesters here. I get that I constantly
do things that affect my life, but at least they are smoothed out over days, weeks, or months.
There usually isn't a concentration of life-affecting-decisions in my day to day life like
I see them in interviews.

I'm not so sure the process is efficient. If you need to weed out people who can't even program,
I feel that is a problem with the education system. I think this goes back to what I wrote a
few weeks ago, that Computer Science should not include both the people who want to become
software engineers and the people who want to do research. A good software engineering program
should not graduate anyone who can't program. That way, we don't need weed-out rounds, and
efficiency goes up.

But is that fair to those who can't afford a good software engineering program? It seems that
efficiency is the enemy of equality, or equity, or whatever the word is. And what about the
people who can't afford to practice these interview questions? The ones who need to already
need to work on other things to survive? This whole whiteboard interview process honestly
feels like the SAT system, where you take a gameable test that has nothing to do with anything
that is just set up so the well off kids can hire a tutor and get a 2700 or whatever the
highest score is so they can get into Yale and then get all the good jobs. Now I do have
to wonder if the point of these systems is to keep the less fortunate out of the fancy
SV offices or if it actually helps with getting the top talent.
