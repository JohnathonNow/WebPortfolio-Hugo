I don't agree with a lot of the actions performed by RMS, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, or Mark Zuckerberg. I find a lot of what Stallman does is over the top and too idealist; I think Gates did the world
a disservice by having his OS reboot my computer whenever he felt like it. I once read that Jobs got a liver transplant by putting himself on the list at a number of hospitals, and I find it offputting
that Mark Zuckerberg flew to a small Colorado town just to tell people that they were no match for his style. I guess if I had to answer which was most and least ethical, I would rank them based off
of what how well I think they followed what I percieve as right as well as how well they followed their own beliefs (in so far as I know what their beliefs are).

I'm just going to complain about Steve Jobs first. I know a lot of people who really look up to him. He's done lots of things that I believe to be important - the iPhone was important for the 
modern smartphone era, and I don't think Pixar would have become an animation company without him. But I was forced to read his biography in high school, and I don't really agree with a lot of what
he does. He was a mean boss, I feel he took too much of the credit for Apple's early success, there was that whole liver thing... Oh, he sold [blue boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_box), and
as much as I hate telecom companies, I do think it is unethical to steal free long distance calls and such. The article calling Jobs the world's greatest philanthropist seems to credit
a lot of his philantrophy to the products his company his made. As far as I know, the iPhone is still made by foxconn, largely in China, using underpaid workers. At least, the internet told
me that their factory practices are controversial. Either way, I'm voting Jobs for unethical - theres no way a man who only eats defenseless apples is a moral person.

RMS is a cool guy. He doesn't drink Coke, which is [probably a good thing](http://ndsmcobserver.com/2014/10/needles-eye/) - Pepsi tastes better anyway.
He is definitely a blowhard when it comes to free software, but for the most part I think he is right, and for the most part he holds very tightly onto his beliefs.
It might just be that I aspire to be more like him, but I do think the world could use more people like him. As far as I know, he really doesn't compromise - he doesn't have a cell phone, because
that could track him. (I mean, he does have a credit card for hotel stays, so I guess he compromises a _little_, but he seems to only do that when he absolutely has to.) I think a lot of people are
more willing to compromise and act against their beliefs - like that Coca Cola thing - I don't know for sure if Coke is abusing workers, nor do I know for sure that any other tech company is, but
they probably are, so I probably shouldn't be using their stuff. I know a lot of people who believe companies are acting imorally but still give that company their business. I know a lot of people
who hate that Apple is spying on them - my sisters freak out whenever Siri knows something she shouldn't, or they get an ad targetting them, but still use their phones all day. It's for these reasons
that I think RMS is the most ethical of the group.

Of course, RMS being the most ethical does not make him the most impactful. Even for me on Google Search "RMS" does not have Richard Stallman on the first page - I don't know anyone outside of [LUG](http://ndlug.org/)
who has a clue who he is. And I'm not so sure he's this mysterious figure who changed the world from behind the scenes, either. It seems that the way most people use technology is against how he would like
them to - his site decries Microsoft, Apple, facebook, Netflix, and others. Microsoft "loves" Open Source, but they'll never release the source of their larger products, nor will Google, Apple, or anyone
else. Maybe some day RMS will have his way, and we'll rename LUG to GLUG, and everyone's software freedoms will be respected, but that day is not today.

I think perhaps Bill Gates might have had the largest positive impact on the world. While the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation might not be spending their money in the best ways possible, the question
was about largest positive impact, and I would find it hard to believe that they don't make up for inefficiencies with the shear amount of moeny they have to spend - they are the largest private
foundation in the United States. He also helped create The Giving Pledge, which is going to add a lot of money for philanthopic causes. Windows _did_ become widespread, and arguably it has had a positive
impact on the world by making computing systems easier to use (ARGUABLY). 

Also there was a reading about Paul Graham and it was not nearly hard enough on him. Though it was written by a character from a [really weird movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_World). Wait, that
was spelled "Would" apparently. Nevermind. I wrote this to get closer to 500 words, but I think I am a little past that. Oops.
