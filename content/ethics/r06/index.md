Until someone convinces me otherwise, I will view Snowden as a hero.
He gave up most everything to do what he thought was right, and he
did what he thought was best for the American people. He may be
a traitor to the American government, but I'm pretty sure people
hardly trust the government anymore anyway. I even think some guy
ran largely on the premise that the government was a swamp that needed
to be drained, but I don't really remember. I think he fought
a war over some building in India with the guy who invented Jeopardy!.
I think he should be pardoned, and probably given a fairly large
sum of money for his troubles, and then we can have a parade.

Snowden collected lots of documents from the NSA, an "unknowable" amount,
and gave them to journalists to decide what should be published. What
was leaked included the use of Section 215 (hey that's my area code) 
to perform mass collection on phone records, that the NSA gets info from
big tech firms via PRISM, that Britain taps fiber lines, that the NSA
spies on embassies, etc. Lots of people argue that he did this
irresponsibly, but I think they would have done it worse. If you
are going to leak documents, you don't want to take the time to
check things, that's how you get caught. I think he acted reasonably,
and people point out that he leaked how we spy on other people, I think
that we maybe shouldn't be spying much at all.

I think what he did was probably moral. He did what he felt was right,
and what he did was probably good for most people. I mean, he may
have violated the whole render unto Ceasar thing, but I think he didn't
expect the response he got. It might be unethical to do something
against your employer, but it's probably unethical to just let
the government do the spying. I guess it's also certainly immoral to
just let the spying happen if you think it is actually harmful.

I'm not sure how much he benefited the public. People made jokes about
the government spying on us before, I think the general population was
just unaware of the scope. It may have hurt America's spying, but I
doubt it did much to national security. I mean, maybe the government
is constantly thwarting terrorist attacks. In that case, maybe this 
stuff is needed. In the US, terrorism causes about 80 deaths per year.
If you ignore September 11th, then it's only 15 deaths per year. Hundreds
of Americans die each year falling out of bed. 87 Americans die per
year by drowning in the bathtub. Personally, I think focusing on self
driving cars might be way more worth the money - 30,296 Americans die
annually in car accidents. Unless the number of people killed by
terrorism exceeds that number, I think we are wasting time and money.

I think the revelations have negatively impacted my view of the government.
The Winter Soldier is one of my favorite movies, and it has a pretty clear
view towards government surveilance. I'm still a little too young to
really have any secrets or anything, but I still think it is important
to make sure the government /can't/ abuse its power. Obama says that
we've hit the perfect balance for security, privacy, and convenience, but
that gives me no guarantee that four years from now a president won't
put big ARGUS-IS cameras on a drone that will put a bullet in my head
for having encrypted files on my computer.

(I also just finished an anime that had an episode somewhat related to
all this, where the government tried to keep a close eye on everyone
because once the population of earth was one million aliens would come
and blow it up. That was the most normal part of the entire show. It
came out in 2007, so pre-Snowden but post 9/11, although I guess Japan
has a different history for this sort of thing. Also, I think the
movie Brazil is relevant.)
