Important Parts
==

I feel as though I was forced to consider what I would do in a situation and what I *should* do
in those same situations. Not sure how I feel about that. Anyway, some things in our code of
ethics stood out to me, such as the following:


Everyone in the computer science community at Notre Dame is on the same side
--

A major part of my development
in HS was FIRST Robotics, and a key tennet of the competition was this idea of "coopertition" - 
that we aren't just competing against each other, but we are also trying to help each other grow.
If your robot didn't work one match, you could bet there wouldn't be a single team not offering to
help you out. I've even seen teams competing in the finals at events use their time out cards
to help their opponents repair their robots between matches. That is everyone being on the same
side.

Do not knowingly give out information that you are aware is incorrect
--

I think this should be a given, like, why would any college student disagree with this? But I've
heard stories. I had a friend a year above me in high school who went off to a nearby Ivy League
school, and told me about how she knows people who intentionally teach others wrong to lower
the average and boost their own positions on the curve. Seriously? 
I applied to another nearby unnamed
Ivy League school and mentioned my friend's experience at the other school, and she said, "Of course
it is like that. Students are competitive, they have to be to get in here." 

I've been fortunate
that Notre Dame is not like that, and when my NYU interviewer asked why I went here for undergrad,
that was my number one reason. I'd like for it to stay that way.

Weaknesses
==

Our honor code suffers the same weakness that many course syllabi and the Honor Code suffer:
how much help is too much? Obviously giving solutions away is usually wrong. But what about hints?
Or mentioning a helpful page in the textbook? I think the line can be blurry, and I think
it is hard to give a general rule that fits every possible case.

Our code is also pretty specific. It was written by two people, so I am sure there are situations
we didn't think of that we should have guidelines for. 

Usefulness
==

I think a code of ethics isn't entirely uselss. It at least sets a precedence for what type of
community we want, as well as what we expect from each other and what we need to expect
from ourselves. It is also useful to enumerate these things, as it gives us a chance
to  think about what we find important, what our beliefs are, and how well we have held our
beliefs up in the past. I think it's also nice that Ryan wrote the two points I highlighted
without me and without any input from me, since the fact that they seem to be held by the community
here is very important to me. It's nice to know that I'm not crazy, and the people here
aren't actually out to sabotage me. It was also a good excercise to think about the right
amount of help to give, because I am a TA and I want to one day teach, so I think it is important
for me to know where to draw the line.
