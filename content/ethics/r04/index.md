Codes of Conduct
==

I do think there is value within Codes of Ethics, as I do agree with the one reading that
explicit is better than implicit. There should be set guidelines as to what is intolerable
in a workplace, as they can serve to protect employees from harassment as well as to protect the 
image of the business as a whole.

Most of the Open Code of Conduct seems agreeable. I especially like the bit about striving
to "Try to understand why we disagree" - I see way too many "discussions" online about relatively
complex issues in which neither side will ever convince the other of anything because they
are both too busy attacking and vilifying each other, when in reality the truth is likely
to be in between the two groups. I see people bring talking points to spew at each other, and
they never both even replying to what the other side said, let alone trying to understand
why they feel the way they do.

I would like some clarifications about the code of conduct, however. 
"We will not act on complaints regarding:" ... 
"Refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts" and
"Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions"
both seem a little unclear to me. If you strive to understand why you disagree, and one side
assumes they are the correct side that is simply follwing the accepted social justice concept,
refusing to explain it seems to go against that. It at least seems that it could be construed
that way, which goes against the benefit that codes of conduct be explicit. I also do not
like the bit about criticizing otherwise oppressive assumptions, which seems WAY too unclear
and broad, as it draws no lines. Is Catholicism oppresive? I bet lots of people think so.
Can I not report it when someone criticizes my religious beliefs? I hope that is not at
all the intent of the writer of this code of conduct, but I am certain that such a code of
conduct will be abused like that.

The Django code of conduct seems a little short. It also mentions following the spirit of the
code, which I don't like. The benefits of these codes I feel is lessened when they are short like
this, and just a "feel good" code of conduct. It doesn't say what to do with offenders beyond saying
"it may affect a person's ability to participate", and it just
gives a few virtues with hardly any examples or explanations. It even says 
"Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's 
primary language.", which seems to open the can of worms that is relativism - what is acceptable
in one culture might not be acceptable in another. Hopefully there are principles in place
for what to do when an offender is from another part of the world, but they don't seem to be
listed here, which again can lead to abuse and is therefore bad.

(I should note that just because something can be abused doesn't mean it should be thrown away.
It just means that considerations should be made to limit abuses, and patch up any holes with
flex tape.)

Google Memo
==

Demore at least seems to say a lot of things the way I feel he should - "this may be why women" or
"more men may like", etc. At least on its surface, he does seem to be just proposing an idea. He
does say some things a little too harshly, but I think the outcome of all of this would have
been the same if he reworded it.

I had originally written several paragraphs about his bit about social engineering of tech to make
it equal for men and women. The gist was that if the gender gap does exist in some non-zero part
because of implicit biases, then perhaps we should do some social engineering to fix that, with
the only problem being that these biases take literally a lifetime to remove. I guess we can
work on mitigating the biases in the mean time, but then what if that creates some of its own, etc.
Anyway, my point is that it's a difficult issue, and I guess he started it with "I don't think", so
it's not presented really as a fact and more as an opinion anyway, so I'll move on.

"areeable" - literally unreadable (pls don't read my other posts for typos, I know I make like five
per post but I always find them after I submitted...)

I wonder if he would have gotten the same reaction if he posted this on his personal
blog. He says some things I agree with, some I disagree with, and a lot of things that
I just don't know enough about to refute. But if it is how he truly felt, then at least
on some level I don't think he should have been fired (especially because now he'll be forever
set on his views - "My firing neatly confirms that point" - the worst thing you can do when you
disagree with someone is completely dismiss them and shut out all dialog). I didn't find the
way he presented his views as antagonistic, and he at least seemed a little open to discussion.

However, somewhat ironically, I do think that firing for "violations of code of conduct" should
be an ideal of the conservatives. If you do something against a written document that tells you
what not to do, and that document says what will happen to you if you violate it, you really
can't complain afterwards. That being said, I don't know what Google's code of conduct says.
It feasibly could have been written such that he really did violate it, and if termination
of employment is a listed consequence, then what happened is fair. I imagine some violations
could be far more egregious, such as constantly harassing someone, and in that case I think
the violator should definitely be fired.

I think care should be taken from both the people who say something offensive and those they
offended. In many cases, the person who said something offensive might not understand why
what they said was offensive (such as all the horrible racists who use the term "gypped"), but
doing what I did and calling them racist is not constructive, and will only ever make the problem
worse (I mean, I'm pretty sure a political party got Trump elected just to spite the other one...)
So I think people should watch what they say, but when you get offended you should approach the
situation a little more lightly, perhaps with a gentle correction, before filing a complaint
with HR. (I know this puts responsibility on a victim of sorts, but it's the best idea I got rn).

I find the last question hard to wrestle with (and I'm like 200 words over the limit already,
sorry). I find it tough because I would like to say you should have the freedom to choose
to work in a workplace that separates them or one that aligns to your personal beliefs, but
I have two issues with that ideal. The first being that that can lead to echo chambers,
which as someone who thinks the solution is often between the two extremes I find to be
bad in general, and the second being that there might only be one company doing the work that
you want to (e.g. if you want to work at Google you'll have to deal with their culture).
Personally, I try to separate my beliefs from my work so that I can troll people because they
don't know how I really feel, but also because I mostly hate the culture of vilifying the other
side and joking around is my way of defusing that.
