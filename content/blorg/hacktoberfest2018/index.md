To be honest, I haven't posted in a while, and this is really just an excuse for
me to do so. Anyways, I'll just briefly be talking about my experience with
Hacktoberfest this year. If you're not familiar with Hacktoberfest, you can
read more about it [here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).

I'll admit that I shamefully only did the minimum 5 pull requests, but
I've had a very busy month. Hopefully I will do better for
[Christmas](https://24pullrequests.com/), when I should have more free
time. Or, at least, I normally would, but I have an exam that if my grade
does not contain the letter 'A' I am put in danger in my PhD program, yay...
Additionally, I'll be going to California for the first time around Christmas,
so I'll be busy traveling. We'll see how it goes.

Anyways, my five pull requests were distributed as follows:

 1. A contribution to my own project, [Wolfratbot](https://github.com/JohnathonNow/wolfratbot). I added discord support to my chatbot.
There's still quite a few open issues with the project, if anyone wants to help. Speaking of help, I got a fair bit of it - there were
six pull requests made by people who weren't me to the project during October.  
 2. A contribution to an open source game I helped write in undergrad, [hag](https://github.com/a3qz/hag). I reorganized the project
to make it much more manageable. I also created an issue and gave it the `hacktoberfest` tag, and a pullrequest solving it was made
within a day, which is pretty cool.  
 3. Some typo correction to the documentation for a joke I helped write in undergrad, [GGNoRe](https://github.com/bdevorem/GGNoRe). I'd
like for this joke to be improved, as I think it is something the world needs. I have been warned to never tell underclassmen in C programming
classes about it.  
 4. Two random contributions to a project I had never seen, but seems really useful [markdown-pp](https://github.com/jreese/markdown-pp). I
just solved two `hacktoberfest` issues, but they seemed to be things people actually wanted, which was cool. The project seems like it can
come in handy, so I'm glad I found out about it.

I also received a number of pull requests to my esoteric language, [arrows](https://github.com/JohnathonNow/arrows-esolang). The first pullrequest
literally just added a period to a description... but later, there were some genuinely helpful pullrequests that add features that the 
interpreter and compiler should have had all along. 

In conclusion, happy Halloween everybody. I'm just now realizing that I should have been jokingly criticizing Hacktoberfest throughout this
post by saying that it isn't spooky, it isn't scary, and it doesn't have [skeletons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTgFtxHhCQ0).
Oh well, there's always next year. I just can't wait until next [Halloween](https://youtu.be/LXXOO3Wd_5Q?t=126)...
