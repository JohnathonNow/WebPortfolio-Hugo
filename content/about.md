My name is John Westhoff.  
Friends call me **Jeffrey** for short (college nickname).  
Or **JohnathonNow** (high school nickname).  
Or **Johnbot** (childhood nickname).  

I am a Junior Computer Science major at the University of Notre Dame.
I live in Stanford Hall, and I really enjoy working on side projects.
I currently serve as the mascot for the 
[Notre Dame Linux Users Group](http://ndlug.herokuapp.com/), and they're
the ones who started calling me Jeffrey.


Anyway, this is my blog of sorts. It primarily serves two purposes:  
    1. To help me get practice with writing and sharing my work.
Communication is a key feature of the human race, and there is a clear
benefit to being good at communicating.  
    2. To help me get practice with documenting my work.
It is not uncommon for me to resume working on something months or even years after
I had stopped - and it can be hard to see where I left off or even how I did things
previously. By documenting everything out in the open like this it should be easier
for me to pick up where I left off. Additionally, using past work can make solving
already-solved problems easier.  

Note that neither of these reasons for the blog's existence require that the blog
have an audience - the purpose of this blog really isn't to share anything - at 
least not at the moment. That being said, I will try to write the posts with
others in mind, as I would like an audience - I just don't expect one.
