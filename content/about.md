My name is John Westhoff. Friends call me **Jeffrey** for short.
Online, I like the usernames **JohnBot** and **JohnathonNow**.<br>
I graduated from the University of Notre Dame in May of 2018, with a BS in Computer Science. Before then,
I lived in [Stanford Hall](http://www3.nd.edu/~stanford/) (pictured above).
I once served as the <s>mascot</s> secretary for the 
[Notre Dame Linux Users Group](http://ndlug.org/), and they're
the ones who started calling me Jeffrey. After graduating from Notre Dame,
I <s>spent the summer running around chanting "37-0" until the Michigan season opener</s> started
my PhD studies at NYU, where I am currently a first year.

My technical areas of interest include
robotics and automation, machine learning, programming languages,
systems, really high level stuff, really low level stuff, 
and just about everything in between.
My current area of research is in distributed systems, which I quite like, but I
feel too young to be any more specific than that.

When I'm not writing code, I tend to my diverse hobbies. I like video games,
and I play a wide variety of them when I have the time.
More recently, I've been playing around with classic games more. I finally
beat Super Mario 64 while procrastinating studying for my graduate algorithms final,
so I have that going for me. 
I've been trying
to pick up wood working,
and when I'm home I'd like to spend a lot of time in the garage
trying to turn things on my lathe.

My girlfriend [breezy](http://bashfulbytes.com/)
is my inspiration for a lot of what I do. We started referring to ourselves as
the CSE Power Couple, and we have worked on some cool projects together.
