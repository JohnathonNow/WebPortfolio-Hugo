My name is John Westhoff. Friends call me **Jeffrey** for short.
Online, I like the usernames **JohnBot** and **JohnathonNow**.<br>
I graduated from the University of Notre Dame in May of 2018, with a BS in Computer Science. Before then,
I lived in [Stanford Hall](http://www3.nd.edu/~stanford/) (pictured above).
I once served as the <s>mascot</s> secretary for the 
[Notre Dame Linux Users Group](http://ndlug.org/), and they're
the ones who started calling me Jeffrey. After graduating from Notre Dame,
I <s>spent the summer running around chanting "37-0" until the Michigan season opener</s> started
my PhD studies at NYU, where I am currently a first year.

My technical areas of interest include
robotics and automation, machine learning, programming languages, really high
level stuff, really low level stuff, and just about everything in between.
If I had the time and money, I'd really like to design a processor, make
a language and a compiler for the processor, and eventually write an operating
system for the processor. Since I can't really do that, I just work on random
little things all the time.

When I'm not writing code, I tend to my diverse hobbies. I like video games,
and I play a wide variety of them when I have the time. I've been trying
to pick up wood working, and when I'm home I spend a lot of time in the garage
trying to turn things on my lathe. My girlfriend [breezy](http://bashfulbytes.com/)
is my inspiration for a lot of what I do. We started referring to ourselves as
the CSE Power Couple, and we have worked on some cool projects together.
