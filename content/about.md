My name is John Westhoff. Friends call me **Jeffrey** for short.
Online, I like the usernames **JohnBot** and **JohnathonNow**.<br>
I graduated from the University of Notre Dame in May of 2018, with a BS in Computer Science. Before then,
I lived in [Stanford Hall](http://www3.nd.edu/~stanford/) (pictured above).
I once served as the <s>mascot</s> secretary for the 
[Notre Dame Linux Users Group](http://ndlug.org/), and they're
the ones who started calling me Jeffrey. After graduating from Notre Dame,
I <s>spent the summer running around chanting "37-0" until the Michigan season opener</s> started
my PhD studies at NYU, where I am currently a second year.

When I'm not writing code, I tend to my diverse hobbies. I like video games,
and I play a wide variety of them when I have the time.  
I've been trying to pick up wood working, and when I'm home I'd like to spend a lot of time in 
the garage trying to turn things on my lathe. Recently, I've also taken on 3D printing, and I
haven't yet burnt down my apartment.

My fianceeington [breezy](http://bashfulbytes.com/)
is my inspiration for a lot of what I do. We started referring to ourselves as
the CSE Power Couple, and we have worked on some cool projects together. We've also won every
project we've ever worked on together, because everything is a competition if you're a winner.
