Everybody knows Mario, he does everything. Go Kart racing, Tennis, Golf, I think he was a boxing referee once... Anyways, once he went on a 
magical dancing adventure, which came with this flimsy dance pad that plugged into your GameCube. It was the first time a DDR game was released
on a Nintendo system outside of Japan, and it was poorly written, pretty poorly designed (69% on Metacritic), and a fair bit of fun.

Most of my issues with the game are that it tries to combine the Mario aspect and the DDR aspect too much, when it would have been better off more on
the DDR side. To unlock the songs, you need to play through the story mode, but there are unskippable cutscenes. It also made me start off on the lower
difficulty. Having beaten the game years ago, I just wanted to jump in on the Hard/Very Hard difficulty and play the later songs in the game.
Honestly, spamming the A button to skip the cutscenes with my foot was way more tiring than actually playing the game. Anyways, the game had fun
remixes of Mario songs, and I plugged the pag into my computer's gamecube ports and it just worked, which was nice. The game is way easier on a classic
gamecube controller, but it's obviously a lot more fun with the dance pad.

It shares a few problems with other rhythm games like Guitar Hero, though. For one, they both have one button that is hard to reach. On Guitar Hero,
the Orange fret can be hard to reach for newer players and those with small hands. In DDR, the back button is harder to press, and I somehow always
end up rotated trying to press it. More importantly, the games seem to forget that they're rhythm games, and half the times the "notes" on the
screen have nothing to do at all with the notes to the songs. This is worse in the easier difficulties in both games, and I think for the harder
difficulties in DDR.

I enjoy both games for what they do, and I think both games would be worse experiences with traditional controls. There are some that throw "innovative"
controls in for no reason, and they only hurt the game. Lots of older Nintendo games, from the NES to the DS, had you blow into a microphone. This
sucks. To get more lives in Mario Kart DS's Balloon Battle mode, you blew into the mic, got light headed, and died. There was a trivia game for the
Wii called Smarty Pants. In it, you could earn more points by doing the "Double Points Dance", where you swung your wii remote in a figure eight, the
faster you swung it the higher your point multiplier went. Well, I may have grabbed the wii remote by the wrist strap and swung it in very fast figure
eights, which may have caused the strap to break, which may have caused the wii remote to fly into the bottom left of the TV and craw the screen.
We may have also used that TV for the next two years. Anyways, these games play better with normal controls.

Games like Wii Sports were a lot of fun. I loved pretty much all of Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort. They showed how well active controls could work,
and they were all games that were more fun than they would have been with traditional controllers. Games like Wii Sports wouldn't benefit from VR or AR
much, however, as they are pretty ordinary activities. Perhaps the biggest benefit to VR is that they can entirely engage you into something you
couldn't experience otherwise. I can go play tennis, there are free courts a mile from my house. I can go bowling, there are like 3 alleys within 10
minutes of home. I can't be a space marine. I can't have any experience of being non-human in the real world.

VR games do have some benefit from motion controls. They can add to the immersion. But in a way, motion controls are limiting. For one, I don't want to
get tired playing most games, especially if I am playing as a fit person. Additionally, with motion controls I am often more limited in how I can control
the game. In sword fighting games, for instance, I have full control over my blade, but almost no control over my actual walking. As a further example,
a spaceship can move along 6 axes: X, Y, Z, and roll, pitch, and yaw. Even traditional gamepads struggle to have fluid controls with that many
degrees of freedom. Say I want to play a game as an octopus. That is very hard with motion controls when I have half as many limbs as what I'm controlling.
