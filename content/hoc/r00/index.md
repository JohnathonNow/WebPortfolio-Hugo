I believe there to be two major classes of video games: immersive and detached.
Immersive games are the more modern breed, and in that category I include games like The Last of Us,
the Uncharted series, maybe UNDERTALE, and other games in which you play as a character and are
meant to be drawn into the game. These games can be like watching a movie, and are the kinds of
games that it can be fun to watch. The other form of game, the kind I call detached, are the games
where you know the full time you are playing a game - the focus is solely on entertainment and not
on story or emotion. Games like Super Smash Bros., Halo (the multiplayer, anyway),
Crawl, and Pong do not draw you into the story - you play them for fun, not for their artfulness.

I believe board games are all detached games as an inherit limitation. There are games that
some might argue count as board games, like Dungeons and Dragons, which I would count as
immersive, but I would classify them as tabletop role playing games and reserve board games
as more restrictive of what the player can do. I do not play chess to feel emotion, I play chess
to have fun trying to outthink my opponent. Actually, I don't play chess at all. Um, when I play
Apples to Apples, I play to enjoy myself with friends - I do not play for the game to give me
a heartwarming story of friendship or anything else. It is hard to build a game to be immersive,
I think, when you are dealing with the physical world. I can see my dirty table while I play
the game, and I have to move all of the pieces - the board games are limited in what they can
do in a way that video games aren't.

Now, I do not mean to say that board games are inferior. In fact, by virtue of being physical,
board games have the oppurtunity to interact with more of our senses than typical video games
do. Board games can be tactile - I feel the Game of Life spinner as I turn it, I can feel the
monopoly money in my hand, and I can flip the table when I am in check in Chess. I can't quite
do that with video games. A game like Jenga simply does not work on the computer (believe me,
I have tried). As virtual reality technology grows in power video games might allow for more
board-game like experiences, but for now there is still a gap.

But this gap is shrinking. There are many video games that are like board games now. I enjoy
Town of Salem, an online game that is similar to the board game Mafia. Town of Salem was actually
_ported_ to a card game, which I think shows how board-game-like it is. Games like Jackbox Party
Pack are essentially digital board games. And it goes the other way, too - there are now AR board
games, such as Smash Tanks! that combine the ability of video games to show the unreal with the
fact that board games exist within the real world. 
This week I played some Cards Against Humanity knockoff about Notre Dame. I think it's funny that
we're talking about that sort of thing in this class, because my first experience with Cards
Against Humanity was in the video game Tabletop Simulator (which was also where I first saw
Secret Hitler). 

I think as technology improves, there will be
more games that blur the lines between board games and video games, which seems like a departure
from history. I believe every early video game was detached - I think if anyone found a game for 
any system older than the PlayStation 2 immersive they must have had a very blocky view of the
world, a view in which the longest sentence anyone ever spoke was "IT'S DANGEROUS TO GO ALONE!
TAKE THIS." That is, early video games could not be immersive as they lacked the technological
power to draw players in emotionally.
Thus, as technology improved, video games shifted to
being more immersive (unless you were Nintendo and insisted on making Mario games, but that's fine
too because Mario Kart is the only good racing game). Now, as technology improves _more_, video
games can become both more immersive and more detached, both through VR/AR technology. In
the future players will be able to hunt for treasure through Nathan Drake's eyes, and I'll
be able to play Jenga with Breanna, seeing her in the same room as me, despite being hundreds of
miles apart. (though I guess by then we'll live closer together. whatever. you know what I meant.)
