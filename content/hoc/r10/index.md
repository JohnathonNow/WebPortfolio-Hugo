After watching Brooks be totally awesome in Halo 5, I decided to try playing some Halo on PC again. I played for a few hours, and did
all right, and recorded some of it because I thought that's what the homework would be like like always. Well it wasn't, and I'm not
going to waste my time with any of this eSports spectator nonsense. I don't watch eSports. I might watch some twitch streams occasionally,
but only for the illusion that I have friends, not for watching any action or anything like that. I am pretty utilitarian, and think
that eSports (and regular person professional sports) don't contribute much to society. Entertainment is a waste of time.

I did sub to Brooks on twitch, but haven't seen any of his stuff. I wonder how much he gets for that.

eSports will probably grow to something that, as a whole, approaches the size of the winter olympics. It is entertaining enough, and as
gaming becomes more mainstream I can definitely see it becoming fairly widespread. But I don't think it deserves that. Of course, I don't
think most professional sporting events do. I think all NCAA games should not be televised, and universities should not be incentivized
to put athletics above academics. We shouldn't pay pro athletes (or actors and actresses) nearly what we pay them, and all entertainment
should be much cheaper, blah blah blah. I like the olympics, they deserve it because of what they stand for. Except for that one time
they decided to have Russia win basketball because the US "needed to learn to lose", and after we won the same game twice we lost the third
replay and they decided we lost. We should go to war over that.

My movie theater will play eSports events maybe twice a year. I don't get it. Who would spend $15 to go to the movies to watch people play
a video game? You can stay at home and watch them play that game. In fact, I think the experience would be better. For events with multiple
streams of different angles and commentators (which, if none of them have that yet, they are behind high school robotics and should be
ashamed) you can have them set up the way you like on your sick 3x monitor set up, because, let's face it, you shouldn't be watching
eSports if you don't have a 144hz g-sync display, a side IPS panel for twitch, and another old monitor on the side too for prosperity.

Speaking of which, why is eSports only gaming? There are other electronic sports, like high school robotics. That's what I followed this
weekend, because there was the half world championship. Half because the organization running it felt they could inspire more kids if they
had two world championships. Anyways, a team from CA won it all, which I knew they would do a few months ago when it became apparent that
they were an order magnitude above everyone else. In fact, they didn't lose a match all season, and went 53-0, and in the hearts and minds
of the community they are now the GOAT, passing the previous GOAT from Indiana, and another GOAT contender from that high school that ryan
went to. This team won their first two world championships the only two times I ever got to go, my freshman and senior years of high school.
This year was also the first year since my junior year that the team didn't qualify for the world championship, which is a shame, they weren't
bad or anything. It's fun to be able to call my brother to yell at him.

I kind of expect my brother to become an eSports gamer. He tried doing Rocket League competively, but he was like, 10 years old, and his team
wasn't that good. He was still in the top percentage or so of all rattata, and puts me and all my friends to shame. He wants to be a meche,
so I'll always be disappointed in him. 

One last thing I guess, when I coached a local robotics team in South Bend the kid who drove the robot was a professional gamer.
That seemed like an advantage. Too bad the robots could hardly drive straight.
