Mortal Kombat
==

I'll admit, I suck at this game. Also, I had to deal with this nonsense the whole time:

Anyways, it's a classic fighting game. I mashed the buttons real good but then the AI just kicked 
me a few times and I died. Anyways, this game is actually a good one to play for this week's
prompt, and it happens to be the only game I have for the SNES that doesn't suck. It also
came out for the SEGA Genesis, but the SNES version was censored, but the SNES version also
has better backgrounds and character sprites. The SNES also had better sound capabilities.
So if you're like me and don't want the gore anyway, the SNES version was just better.

Fortnite
==

I was told we could also just play shooters and what not, so I did that, since I don't have
any other in-genre SNES games, my N64 is at home (I have my controllers and a USB adatper, though),
and my mom threw out our PS1 (and PS2). 

Anyways, Fortnite is a "battle royale" game, where 100 people land on an island. You scavenge
for weapons, and kill each other, and last man standing wins. You can also build walls and things,
which is what makes it different from most other shooters and battle royale games. 

I am bad at shooter games. For proof, I has a clip of my first sniper kill in Fortnite:

After shooting that person, I ran over to take their things, and was prompty shot in the face and
died.
Compared to my brother, who plays these sorts of games all the time, I suck. For reference, here
is a video he posteed of him playing Overwatch:

{{< youtube AEXM-Q09N5E >}}

He has a lot of videos like that one. He's pretty OK at showing off.

Like
most shooters, there is no cross play between different systems (PC users have an advantage as
aiming is easier with mice, and Sony doesn't want to give up their lead in the console
market at all). This highlights what I feel is the biggest decider when buying a console, at least
post XBOX - you buy what your friends buy. In the world of online gaming, you can only play
with your friends on the same console as you. No one wants to be the only guy with a PS3
when all their friends have the Xbox 360.

Favorite Console
==

I see people argue over consoles all the time on the internet. I hear people use terms like
"xbot" and "nintendrone" - what are you, five? Why are you bashing people for owning a console
other than the one your mom bought you? (I say that having only ever purchased the New Nintendo
3DS for myself.) Anyway, I see people argue specs, so I guess that has to do with it, but I think
they're clueless for the most part (I hope they were trolling, but I saw a comment that said
"The GTX 1080Ti only has 11GB of memory, the PS4 has 500GB and they're coming out with a 1TB model,
that's twice the power"), as the games are very often similar for all systems it is released on
(with the exception of when one is just outclassed - the Wii did not get the same games as the PS3
or 360, for instance, and exclusives - Uncharted 3 and The Last of Us I feel weren't matched
by anything on the 360 visually). Most people tend to agree it comes down to the games, namely
the exclusives. More recently, I've seen people acknowledge that most people just end up
getting what their friends get.

Personally, we got a PS3 because it had a bluray player. That's it. We did have a PS2 and PS1,
but they were for my sisters, and they had out grown video games by the time the PS3 was out.
We got the N64, GameCube, Wii, and Wii U because I wanted those, and the family got a lot of
use out of all of them. If you could handhelds, I also had a GameBoy Color, GameBoy Advance,
DS, and 3DS. Last year my dad bought the PS4, as our PS3 was struggling with working, and you could
get it for dirt cheap. My brother and I got a Nintendo Switch for Christmas, which is at home
because I didn't want to be a jerk and take it with me. He hasn't touched it at all.

I primarily play games as a social experience - I pretty rarely play single player games, or even
online games by myself. I did spend 20 hours the last few weeks playing Celeste, which I highly
recommend, but that is on every console, and I just beat Breath of the Wild, but I was emulating
it.
So, most exclusives don't appeal to me. (Halo dropped
split screen, the only game I've ever wanted to play on Xbox, and so did Uncharted in between
3 and 4.) So, I really like systems with a lot of couch multiplayer games. So in that sense, PC
wins more than most people realize, but all of the Nintendo consoles have really excelled, so
I've always wanted them. The Wii and Wii U made for great party games. But then Nintendo
did something I've always wanted - they made a full console that runs on batteries and 
lets multiple people play on the go - the Switch. Breezy and I went to a The Killer's concert
in NYC, and took the train down, and played Mario Kart 8 on the switch the whole way down.
We just used the kickstand on it, and popped off the two controllers and played for a few hours.
So, I'd have to say the Switch is everything I really wanted in a console. Since the controllers
snap to the side of the thing, it is more portable than a laptop, and laptops like to turn
into fireballs, so it is better for being portable while still letting you play with
the people sitting next to you.
