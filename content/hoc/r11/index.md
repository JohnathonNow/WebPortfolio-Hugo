[Video Games caused everything that's wrong in the world](https://youtu.be/_T25UWrjXZA?t=14m34s), like obesity,
real life violence, and misogyny.

Video Games have some real social issues, ranging from breeding stupid nerds who call everyone apes, to
breeding misogynist nerds, to causing nerds to gamble away their life savings, to the media blaming gun violence
on games because the NRA desparately needs a scape goat right now.

There is a lot of mixed results about how much violence video games actually cause. I've heard a fair
bit of studies claiming that video games make people more aggressive, but, like, if anyone funded that, they're
apes, and have clearly never seen anyone play video games before. That's like funding research to test whether
it hurts to look at the sun. Everyone already knows that. Mario Party and Mario Kart have probably led to more
murders than any shooting game. Or at least, more fist fights.

I think Video Games are used to cover more important issues. Like, in that one death caused by SWATting, why
did the officers just, you know, shoot that guy? I get that it's a risky situation, but, like, don't you at least
start negotiations or something with a megaphone? I'm not OK with cops being judge, jury, and executioner.
Only [lifeguards](https://i.redd.it/npyanopw521z.jpg) should be trusted with that much power.

The ESRB sucks, and should be disbanded. Also, the [ESA sucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-gN-pvdaaU).

Regulation of media is silly. Also, reddit needs to ban r/watchpeopledie, that's just not OK. But most importantly,
the ESRB does not rate online interaction. The ESRB does not care about gambling. The ESRB does not care about
the way games are played today. Not rating online play is silly, because that is more than half of modern gaming.
Mario Kart 8's online interactions are vastly different from League's. We should probably have a "you can say
mean things in this game" label. Also, games are never released these days, making the ESRB useless. I say
we just get rid of it all together. It was never a good idea to have an industry regulate itself. It was basically
just a way for games to advertise themselves on the covers. 

Games can be art. Games also can make money. So, because people get sad, they make games about depression,
and then get harassed online. Further, becuase people are greedy, they make their friends make video games,
then add microtransactions to them, and then make money. Oh, that was an example of both symptom
and cause, great, now it's a viscious cycle.

I bet video games have caused a few marriages to fail, because guys have to get up 4 times a night to play xbox.
Video Games let some people gamble, too, and some of them are whales who spend enough money to fund my education
on fake game points. Oh, and there are a bunch of con artists in games. And ethics in gaming journalism, and
misogyny. Bascially, gaming culture is one of the worst cultures, at least as bad as anime culture.

Online games let me play games with my family. I can play card games with my parents, fighting games with my
little brother, and board games with my other siblings. Further, I'm sure some people are the types of angry people who would do harm if they couldn't play league of legends and yell at people online.
