Warning: this post might suck a little, I forgot about it until 3:21am, ~9 hours before it was due. Ryan mentioned it to me
when we had to go start a 3D print at 3AM. I'm still sad-ish about my interview. I do have some thoughts that aren't absolutely
terrible, though.

Early developers had to deal with a few interesting issues - some technical, and some more social. 
On the technical side,
they were dealing with limited hardware. Really limited. At first they were creating circuits to create the games. They also had
to work with displays that were far less clear than todays. Tennis for Two, for instance, used coordinate plotting on
an oscilloscope - it's hard to get much lower resolution than that. 

Socially, video games weren't a thing that had really existed before. Most of the early video games seemed to be something
more people could relate to - sports. People seemed to love tennis, so they made Tennis for Two and Pong. Most of the 
Odyssey games were sports related, too. Do you know what games I play today? [STARWHAL](http://store.steampowered.com/app/263020/STARWHAL/)
the space narwhal jousting simulator, Octodad: Dadliest Catch, the be-an-octopus-but-dont-let-your-family-find-out game for all ages,
and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the fantasy game set in the future where you play as an elf man on a motorcycle and
use a wooden bow to shoot laser dagger arrows. I feel early game developers were limited in both what they could do technically,
and what they could sell creatively.

The players struggled through garbage controls. Tennis for Two looks like it used a knob and a button. The Magnavox Odyssey
seems to use a reset button, two potentiometers for vertical and horizontal control, and a third poteniometer to razzle-dazzle
your opponent into submission. While in some sense the controls haven't changed much in principle (the inner workings of an Xbox
controller are six potentiometers, one each for the triggers, and two each for the joysticks), they have been massively refined
to the point that they haven't changed much in the past 15 years. (Though I think they should change, as I feel we are limited
in control for some completely novel 3D games, but that's for another day.) Today I have a choice in my controller, too.
I even spent a few hours this semester adding GameCube controller ports to my desktop, just to play using the controllers
I grew up using.

Players were also limited in what they can play. I have 280 games in my steam library, and about 120 unredeemed steam codes
on my Humble Bundle account. I could not play all the games I own in my life if I tried. I can play my games anywhere. I can
literally stream my computer games to my cell phone and play them anywhere. I don't have to go anywhere special to play games.
Tennis for Two was created for a visitor day at a research lab. I have a feeling not a lot of people got to play it. Who the explitive
word had a PDP-1 to play `Spacewar!` on? Certainly in the early days it seems like not a lot of people would have their video games
to waste their lives on.
