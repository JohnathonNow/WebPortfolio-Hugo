Backstory
===

OK, well, I ignored most of the arcade stuff, because this class is classist and I don't have any money,
because I went to make sure my car would start to go to Strikes and Spares so I drove to Meijer and then locked
my keys in my car and had to spend more than all of my money on a locksmith, causing me to overdraft my account
and incur a $13 penalty. I mean, me too thanks. So I mostly did minigolf because $4 and two rounds of bowling
because buy one get one free.

Proof that I got locked out, and that it's all pbui's fault:

Mini Golf
===

The first thing I did there was play a round of minigolf. I have no photos, lost by a lot, and generally just
didn't do well. Well, arcades do have the niceness of being social events. I can't play games at my house with
such a large group, but we can totally go to an arcade funzone and play the games, even ones that aren't minigolf.
There is a place near my house called TNT, that one angry video game nerd went there once for a review. Anyways,
I've been to many fun parties at TNT, and played lots of that one xmen game where he says XMEN, WELCOME, TO DIE!

Well, enough that I built my own arcade machine and tested it with that game. Oh geeze, there's even
a picture in my [blog post about it](https://johnwesthoff.com/projects/arcademachine/).

Bowling
===

I played my best round of bowling in my life by about 42 points, bowling an almost decent 153. I had a total of
four strikes and a spare or two. Because I am unable to control the fingers on my right hand independently,
holding a bowling ball hurts my hands. Maybe I should throw the ball like Dan Wilborn. Anyways, this caused
me to suffer greatly, leading me to bowl an 86 in my second game. I bet if I continued, I would probably
[bowl a gentleman's forty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_LDnkKKd3Y).

Anyways, there's not a lot to say about that. Here's a picture of me after bowling:

In General
===

Arcades allow for more inovative hardware, especially racing games, where you can steer with a wheel (and those
things cost bank for the PC or consoles) or even your whole body for the racing games. They have pseudo VR games,
like whackamole clones, which have much greater tactile feel. Some arcades are starting to get regular VR games,
which will mark a return to the times of arcade games just being PC games with relatively inaccessible hardware.
Disney Quest, the best arcade to ever be closed, had VR games like 15 years ago. They also had a game where you
drove a real tank, like bumpercars, that shot dodgeballs and caused who'm'st'ever you hit to spin out. Pretty Dope.

Unfortunately arcades are being stupid, and buying into games like Crossy Road, a poor mobile clone of a
game from like 30 years ago. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Oh well, the social aspect might carry through. I am being
serious when I say some of my fondest memories are from arcades in my area. Many of which have closed down.
The sights and sounds of busy arcades are an experience I hope that future generations will get to have too,
and I do believe that there will always be arcades. A new one just opened up in my hometown about 3 years ago.
They keep sending me emails trying to get me to take a job there. They use a time based system instead of quarters,
which I kind of like. It was on the small side though, but they had a lot of pinball machines. Well, many
were digital with LCD displays. Those suck, and will be the reason that arcade goes under.
