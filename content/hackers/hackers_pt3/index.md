I'm really not a fan of answering questions. So, I wrote
[a blog post kinda about Thursday's class](https://johnwesthoff.com/projects/atariusb/).
Anyway, as this is "graded" I guess I should write something that vaguely
answers the questions the website asked to to answer.

As a marketplace formed for software, it became possible for hackers to make
bank writing it. Rights to software became an issue, as it was no longer
just shared openly and freely (because now it was worth something), which is
a huge point of sepparation between the first and third generation of hackers.
There were some people who saw software as a means to get rich, rather
than as something that can change lives. Pat Mariott has the best quote in the
whole book so far, saying, "I want to get rich, by the way." Ken <s>Jennings</s>
Williams is probably my new personal hero. He was a true hacker, judging people
solely by their abilities <s>as a hacker</s> to make him money. Maybe that is a
bit harsh. Maybe not. He is the kinda guy to put a price on friendship - about
$10,000.

The third generation seemed comparable to the first generation in their respect
towards authority, however. The hacker staff of Sierra On-Line didn't seem
to like the transition to being a formal company. They ran into legal trouble,
and didn't care too much for the formalities of lawsuits. John Harris found
Atari to be very restrictive towards those who could write software for their
machines. Another similarity is their belief that computers could change
lives - Bob Davis is a prime example of this. 

Markets demand things quickly. The hardware hackers knew this - they could
hardly fill the demand that was being placed on them. With hardware, creative
tricks became less important than safe designs that would work. Now with
software quality would become second to speed. It became the case that
releasing something unpolished to meet a deadline was better than releasing
something of the best quality. To this day this is the case, especially
now that programmers can release patches. Anyway, if you could market it, you
could sell it. You don't need quality, you need sales. It makes sense,
but it isn't something that is very good. As the companies grew in complexity,
they needed more parts to sustain it, they needed business people.

OK, gonna be really lazy here because I wanna go play video games and it's
8:41 on Friday night right now, and I'm just gonna literally paste
the last three questions here and answer them.

>"Did you really benefit from your computer if you did not program it?"

Yes. My mom used to love playing [some word game](http://www.pogo.com/games/word-whomp),
but she certainly couldn't program, in fact, she couldn't ever grasp that
that game did not require a subscription to America Onlne to play, they
just had a link to it on their website. Many pieces of software improved
common people's workflows, even if they didn't use perfectly written software
or if they could never fix up the programs they were using. 

>"Did the public benefit from one company 'owning' a piece of software and preventing others from making it useful?"

My heart says no, as open source software tends to be pretty usable, and
I do love being able to fix things when they don't work. However, there must
be something I am missing, as programs like Microsoft Word and Adobe Photoshop
are simply better than any free alternatives. (Libre Office sucks so hard,
I'd honestly rather edit the XML files in vim.)
I would say it might be something about large monolithic projects that
do much better in the hands of closed companies than in hands of hackers
who will get bored and abandon the project when it's only half finished, but
then I remember that I'm typing this on a machine running the Linux kernel,
which is a pretty big project that I think did just fine. 
Sometimes the closed-ness of software is a huge problem, though. Like,
I should not be banned from playing online just because I thought that
I should be allowed to play as a character who can kill anyone else in one
hit in [Super Smash Bros.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros.)
I had another point against closed software, but I forgot it. Oh well.


>"Could they grab the ring and not be corrupted? Could whatever idealism existed in their mission be preserved? Could the spirit of hackerism survive the success of the software industry?"

The idealism can cerainly survive, but it is still often the case that
nice guys finish last. There have been hugely successful open source projects
that very closely follow the hacker ethic, with no one doing it for profit
or anything of the sort. The thing is, they often aren't making money.  
Big closed companies who don't care at all about the hacker ethic rise to the
top. 
Despite being [the worst company in America](http://www.tomsguide.com/us/Consumerist-Poll-worst-Company-in-America-electronic-arts-SimCity,news-16921.html),
EA has done incredibly well for themselves. 
I think the majority of people do have a price, and there is a certain
point where you don't care about your ideals, you don't need to care about
anything any more, you're set for life.

Anyway, I'm bored. I think this [other article I wrote](https://johnwesthoff.com/hackers/interesting) also should be mentioned before I give up and submit this.
