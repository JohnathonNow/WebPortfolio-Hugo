Despite spending all day interfacing a Nintendo GameCube Controller with
my laptop, I found this section of the book, titled Hardware Hackers,
to be extremely boring. 

Anyway, technology certainly can be a tool for good or evil, depending on
who is using it and for what. To quote [the greatest rock band ever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styx_(band)):

> The problem's plain to see:  
> Too much technology.  
> Machines to save our lives.  
> Machines dehumanize.  

Technology is capable of enhancing
our lives dramatically. Research into medical treatment, as well as a huge
number of pieces of medical equipment, are the result of technology. Computers
themselves connect us in a way unlike any other device in human history. It is
very clear that technology can be used for good, but it is equally clear
that they can be used for oppression and malice. The unheard-of connectedness
that modern technology provides has given governments an unprecidented ability
to spy on its citizens.

To me it seems the Hacker Ethic had to be stretched a little. 
As computers became more commonplace, there would end up being users who
disagreed with the Hacker Ethic, which would create friction. This would become
more true as time went on, and more and more non-hackers would begin to use
computers. As systems became more complex, users would have to become more
specialized - you probably did not care to take the time to understand it all.
So, many Hardware Hackers were fine with purchasing (or pirating) a copy
of BASIC, as it meant they could use their machine more easily, while the 
older generation of True Hackers felt the language was against what they stood
for. 

A bigger source of friction, however, was with commercialization.
We would not have the level of computing power we have today if computers
we not commercialized. A big part of commercialization is competition,
and as the majority of users cared less and less about how their machines
worked and more about the machine working at all, machines would become
less maintainable (Motherboards today are 4+ layers, with maybe one or two
DIP chips total, rather than 2 layers [front and back] with nothing but
easy to replace DIPs.); further, machines built to avoid user maintenance
can be smaller (since no one needs to get inside it), can be more reliable
(since no one should be breaking it), and can potentially run faster
(since no one needs to understand how it works, it can be more complex). This
increased complexity along with an increasing audience would make it so that
developing reliable software was a more difficult task, one 
[some people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) felt that one should
be paid for. This obviously violates the Hacker Ethic - information should be
free, but without this violating, we wouldn't have Rocket League, and who
wants to live in that world?

The Hardware Hackers are a lot closer to the Hacker ideal that I admire.
The Hardware Hackers disagreed with the purity of the True Hackers, most notably
their reluctance to spread technology to the "losers". They, like me, feel that
the True Hackers are a bit removed from the real world, holding onto ideas
that seem simple to themselves but simply cannot be done in practice.
True Hackers seemed to be annoyed with the apathy of the Hardware Hackers
towards clever hardware tricks, which hackers like Felsenstein felt
were risky and unnecessary. Hardware Hackers have a point here, if a product
is meant for the masses, why bother trying to work out some clever trick
when something more straightforward would get the product out sooner
(which is what the users want) for something the user would never ever
notice (which they don't care about)?

Key to dispelling the mysticism surrounding the world of technology
was getting technology into the hands of the masses, and giving them an
understanding of how the tech worked. Kits are the prime example of this,
from Radio Electronics' 8008 kit to
[recently resurrected Heathkit / Heath Company](http://hackaday.com/2015/12/17/heathkits-triumphant-return/).
Kits allowed anyone to build pieces of technology and hopefully gain
some knowledge while doing so. 
Community Memory served as a way to demonstrate the usefulness of computers
to the people, as it allowed for public access in a far more approachable
setting than in the past. Anyway, I think I answered the questions enough, and
I realize that I've probably been boring, so I'll stop here. After all, I don't
have the kind of last name to get away with lying about how my grandfather
did something with a computer besides opening Outlook to send my dad chain
emails.
