My name is John, but people call me Jeffrey for short.
This is my introduction post for [CSE40842](http://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.40842.sp17/);
in this class I hope to make a bunch of cool stuff and learn about making
a bunch of cool stuff.

I have a wide array of interests and hobbies, and to fill the page with words
I guess I'll go over a few of them:

Interests:
==========

Robots:
-------
Throughout high school I was very involved with my school's 
[FIRST](http://www.firstinspires.org/) robotics team, and we did 
[pretty well for ourselves](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/2607/history).
After coming to Notre Dame I started "helping" a local team, though
they only competed for two seasons after I started with them and they are
now non-existent.
Because I come from a robotics team background I am very into more mechanical
things, especially when they related to Computer Science. 
My favorite video of all time is
[this one describing the parts of a Navy fire control computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1i-dnAH9Y4), and I read [Hackaday](http://hackaday.com/)
several times a day.

College Football:
-----------------
Probably can't name a single player, but it's pretty hard to go to Notre Dame
and not enjoy football. I think it was our [37-0 win over Michigan](http://www.espn.com/ncf/recap/_/id/400547944)
that won me over.

Trivia:
-------
I'm really pretty bad at trivia, but I'd like to get better at it.
I'm awful at pop culture stuff because I can't remember names or faces,
but sometimes I remember things pretty well. I love [Jeopardy!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!)
and spend my first day of every break binging it with our [TiVo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TiVo).


Hobbies:
========

Video Games
-----------
A lot of people think I spend a lot of time playing video games,
but that isn't really true (if we go off Steam numbers, over the last
7 years I have averaged 2.3 hours per week, but if anything that
number is inflated from leaving games running). Despite that, I
do enjoy video games, and I am pretty good at some of them, and really bad
at others.  
I almost exclusively play local multiplayer games
(things like [Ultimate Chicken Horse](https://www.cleverendeavourgames.com/ultimate-chicken-horse/),
[Crawl](http://www.powerhoof.com/crawl/), and 
[Rocket League](https://rocketleaguegame.com/)), though I do occasionally
enjoy single player games with good stories
([Undertale](http://undertale.com/) comes to mind).
I've also attempted making my own games on a number of occasions,
with varying degrees of success.


Making Nonsense
---------------
I love making stuff. All kinds of stuff. In addition to the more technical
stuff [I post about](https://johnwesthoff.com/projects), I also enjoy
woodworking. For my 21st birthday, I got alcohol and a 
[lathe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lathe) (a winning combination!).
Since then, I have been practicing quite frequently, and have poured a fair
bit of money into it.
Anyways, my bedroom has a [drill press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drill#Drill_press)
a [workbench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workbench), and an array of tools.
My garage has a lathe and a [miter saw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miter_saw), and my dormroom has a [soldering iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldering_iron),
[rotary tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_grinder), and
an "industrial-strength" [hot glue gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot-melt_adhesive).
These are some of my most prized possessions, and I love it when I have
an excuse to use them. 

Being Annoying
--------------
My ultimate goal in life is to have been as annoying as possible.
Everything I do is meant to annoy someone.
Therefore, I guess it is my biggest hobby.
