I figure I can start a blog post with

 > Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine  
 > Gotta gotta be down because I want it all  
 > It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this  

because apparently a certain someone doesn't know that song.

I'm a bit sick of reading about startups from people who've
successfully exited their startups. They almost never seem
to understand how lucky they've been. PG seems to equate
luck as something Bill Gates needed to become a billionaire, not something
someone needs to be a millionaire. He even writes,
"there are plenty of other ways to get money, including chance" implying
that startups are not hugely dependent on luck.
He also takes the attitude that most startups are high-tech, which seems
very narrow-minded and even a bit self gratifying. This attitude
ignores family restaurants, craft stores, and a host of other common startup
types. Most startups are not at all high tech.
Google did not start high-tech, nor did Facebook, Uber, or any other
household-name-startup. (Maybe I'm being close minded, but high-tech means
cutting edge, and to me that excludes anything that could be cloned by
a 17 year old in his basement with enough spare time.) Google rose
to being high-tech, but well after they were a "startup".
Facebook is still not _really_ high-tech, but they own Occulus, which
is a behind-the-cure VR company. At least they have my hero,
[John Carmack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack).
Uber just doesn't count. Maybe I should bash Tesla, too. Their
"self-driving" cars could most definitely be replicated by a few high-school
robotics teams I've seen.
(I wonder if I believe any of what I just wrote.)

Oh! I almost forgot, I hate his complaint about the pie analogy. Our universe
is finite, therefore, no matter what, there is only so much wealth.
So, the rich people are still oppressing me.
Or rather, there is a state of the universe in which I hold the maximum
quantity of wealth, and the rich people are making it harder for that universe
to be the one in which I live.

I've actually "helped" a friend with two of her startup ideas. The first was a
VR-like venture that I am bound by NDA to not talk about. The other was related
to the audio mixing thing I linked in my last blog post. She holds like 
3 patents now, which is neat. I may or may not want to do one myself. It seems
like I'd prefer doing something guarenteed to at least positively contribute
to the world in some way, rather than do something that has a 1% chance
of not causing my money to go away and leave me and a few collegues unemployed.
Of course, I could try to do both - work for a bit and develop on the side.
After all, startups aren't high-tech. I can be a decade behind the curve,
who cares? It's still a spin of a roulette wheel, and I figure I'm just as
likely to win big by cramming for 2 years as I am by spreading it out over 10.

I've typed a fair bit, I probably [should move on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BwzP1laWkQ).

But I really don't want to. I should have titled this post
_PG Makes Jeffrey Actually Hate Him and Humanity Itself_.
I am almost sure PG has delusioned (is that a word?) himself. He has to have.
I think this bit sums up how disconnected he is from the real world:

 > You get paid by doing or making something people want, and those who make more money are often simply better at doing what people want. 

I mean, I know he says "often", but his whole tone tells me he really
thinks "I can think of one or two exceptions" and not "this is true 50.01%
of the time." PG has the attitude that people can just be more productive.
He cites people arguing about whether or not the world was round,
but shows that he doesn't understand philosphy [despite having
a BA in it] by stating how Eratosthenes
was off by 2% when he used the shadow lengths of cities to estimate the
circumference of earth. This is a circular argument - to approximate
the earth's circumference, you have to assume that it is a sphere, and so you
cannot use an approximation of the earth's circumference to prove that the
earth is a sphere. (The cities could all have been on hills, for instance.)
It's this kind of thinking that leads to calling unwealthy groups
unproductive.

I believe people who follow PG's line of thought have two
options: accept that there is a wealth imbalance inherent to capitalism,
or realize that the wealth imbalance is inherent in the human genome.
Either wealth is unfairly distributed at the top because of the way
the system works and not because of how people just aren't productive,
or they are just not productive because that is the hand they were dealt.
In either case, the system is not fair. And PG seems to think it shouldn't be
fair. But why should offering something people want be valuable? It seems
he's just trying to justify his worldview. If anything, we should value
things people _need_. I'd argue that while there should be some incentive
for working hard (i.e. increased wealth), but 100x is just silly. Half
the world needs to work to live, why should anyone be justified in
retiring early and buying a mansion?

Is it really stealing from the wealth makers? I'll say no, and cite the
Catechism of the Catholic Church:

 >  The seventh commandment forbids theft, that is, usurping another's property against the reasonable will of the owner. There is no theft if consent can be presumed or if refusal is contrary to reason and the universal destination of goods. This is the case in obvious and urgent necessity when the only way to provide for immediate, essential needs (food, shelter, clothing . . .) is to put at one's disposal and use the property of others. ([CCC 2408](http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2408.htm))

I would argue it is entirely within the universal destination of goods
that wealth be more evenly shared - if it is at all possible for
starving people to be fed _today_ then why should anyone argue that
it is ok for there to be a huge wealth gap? Technology might provide
the answer, but only by creating a huge wealth gap. We need something
more than technology. Besides, there is a current fear that technology
will lead to huge job displacement - by PG's logic, this is fine: machines
do the jobs better, so they get the money. But they're machines, so their
owners get the money. Now how is that acceptable? You are better at
having had money to buy machines to make money, so you get more money?
If I could curse, I would say that is some word followed by "backwards".

PG wasn't wrong about the web, though he was wrong about desktops dying.
I guess he wasn't aware of computer gaming. [Cloud Gaming has been trying to be
a thing for like, my entire life, and it's still entirely impractical.]
Since I've typed a lot already, and a common pattern for my blog posts is
to get lazy towards the end, I'll get lazy here and paste the prompt.

<br>

> What do you think is the next big technological platform? Wearables? VR? Web? Mobile? Desktop? If you had to make an application today, what would you target and why?

<br>

**VR?** No. It's prohibitively expensive. ($800 VR Headset + $600 GPU + $300
CPU + $100 RAM + $100 MBoard + $100 the rest = no widespread adoption.)
Will prices go down? Sure, but the specs also need to go up. We need a way
to feel force inside the VR worlds. Equipment needs to get less bulky.
The price also has to go down to beat other options. 

**Wearables?** I feel like this was a cash-grab from the industry. No one
ever thought they were a good idea. Google learned first hand that no
one wants them. Apple has had some success, but with a Watch that everyone
wanted, then no one wanted, then everyone wanted again.

**Web?** Isn't that where we are now? It is, and if I develop something
new, it will tend to be what I focus on. That or just a linux native app.
Sometimes Java. Java is good. Anyway, I enjoy multiplatform things, like
PhoneGap, so I can essentially do web + android + ios in one go. Still not
as good as desktop though.

**Mobile?** Also kind of already happened. See web for how I make mobile stuff.
Still has a lot of room for taking off more, though. We probably won't see
another iPhone 1, but it's a pretty consistent market, with guarenteed
revenue for big players like Apple and Samsung. App wise, there is lots
of room for things to make big bucks, but the slice of the pie you can
reasonably hope to cut for yourself is shrinking.

**Desktop?** What a weird way to ask that. Does that exclude laptops? Or
are those mobile? Did I misunderstand the categories? Desktops are
the go to for high power requirements. Some would argue the cloud is replacing
that, but that's expensive and [hokey](https://www.youtube.com/v/0ghGWWfzq-o&start=673&end=676&version=3&autoplay=1).
Video games belong here, and here they shall remain.

**Something else?** I can see multiplatform becoming bigger. Also [this book I was forced to read freshman year of high school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_(Anderson_novel))
might be onto something. In any case, I can't wait to post this, because
when I do, bobbit should message the wrong me, which will lead to, well,
nothing even remotely interesting, maybe I should fix that.

<br><br><br>
OK, I fixed it!
I was getting worried that I wouldn't get to goof off in this post,
but now all is right with the world.
