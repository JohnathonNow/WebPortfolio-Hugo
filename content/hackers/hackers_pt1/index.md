Before reading the book at all, my idea of a hacker was shaped by two primary
sources: *sci-fi movies* and *the internet*.  

I spend a lot of time on the interwebs, and two of my most visited
websites are [Hackaday](http://hackaday.com/) and 
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).
Hackaday largely gave me the impression that 
hackers love doing more with less - the blog is filled with people
doing crazy things like [making a small Wi-Fi connected "Game Boy" that
cheats to be able to play modern games like Witch 3](http://hackaday.com/2016/11/07/tiny-game-boy-that-plays-witcher-3-and-other-things-that-blew-my-mind/).
And the people doing these things aren't doing them for profit or anything,
but because they enjoy it. HN on the other hand very often has people doing
things for money (it is part of a startup incubator's website, after all),
but with a similar openness that I've come to enjoy from the code slinging
community of the internet.

Movies like [WarGames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames) depict a hacker
as a tech-savy kid who likes to break into things with a computer.
These movies typically show a clear separation between the hacker and the rest
of the world. They sometimes have the hacker toy with the nonhacker. This
leads to the impression that hackers either are, or just feel better than 
the others.

Levy describes True Hackers as the original hackers, the ones who first followed
the Hacker Ethic with an intense curiosity towards computers. The term comes
from the lingo of the TMRC, where a "hack" was a project done for enjoyment from
involvement.
The most productive members of the Signals and Power Subcommittee
of the TMRC called themselves "hackers". 
A number of early hackers were prime examples of the Hacker Ethic.
Stew Nelson, for instance, decided to add a new instruction - "add to memory" -
to the PDP-1, which highlights the first point of the Hacker Ethic, that access
to computers should be unlimited and total.
Peter Deutsch is another example - at only twelve years old, he came to be
accepted by the hacker community. He was accepted because of his hacker ability,
which the Hacker Ethic states is the only thing one should be judged on.

Levy's depiction of a hacker is fairly close to my previous understanding.
One difference might be that the modern use of the word to me often carries
with it the sense that the hacker is doing something that is unintended by
some group - for instance, a console hack is using the console differently
from the intent of the maker. The very first use of the word didn't
seem to carry that - the early hacks weren't often things unintended by anybody,
but it seemed to quickly pick up that meaning, as the hackers would do
things *someone* didn't want them to, be it accessing parts that the department
locked away or using precious machine time for more frivolous things.

I am not quite sure how I feel about the idea of a True Hacker. In many ways,
I find their ideals appealing. I like the idea of free information, the hands
on imperative, mistrust towards authority, the use of computers for art, and
the use of computers to improve lives. The one thing I feel the need to
push back against is judging solely on hacking ability. I believe people
ought not be judged, and that judging based off ability can be a bad idea,
especially since you might not know one's true ability (and there are too many
of us to all think the same way, and so on). I also disagree with the lengths
they went to promote free access to information. I feel information should be
free, but breaking into rooms for parts, even if they are cheap, is not OK.
One should encourage others to grant free and total access, but never force
them to.
