Did I really put "graded" in quotes last time? Wow. Why do you put up with
this?

Anyway, I strongly agree with the similarities Paul Grahamcracker draws between
painters and hackers. Just a few days ago I noticed that my closest friend
here, <u>The English Major</u>, and a friend from high school who was
apparently the first guy from my high school I ever met but didn't
recognize him on the first day of school when he said hi to me and
felt so embarrassed he didn't talk to me for a few years and
is now apparently an English major too, Liam, have more in common with me
than they have in common with my roommate, a MechE named 
[Joey JoJo Jr. Shabadoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dbi3--k4SM). 

For starters, they are the only ones who will listen to my ramblings about
[Pumpkin Lemmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumping_lemma_for_regular_languages)
and various [lengths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEpsKnWZrJ8)
of [wire](http://i.imgur.com/03baM1F.gif). Before becoming
<u>The English Major</u>, he was a civil engineer who was going to switch
to Computer Science. Similarly, Liam is the only non-computer-science person
to ever ask me about Linux. Of course, these are only superficial similarities
and not really what Mr. Smores was talking about.

We also think fairly similarly. Shabadoo is a scientist - as Saul describes,
he solves solved problems perfectly. On the other hand, I sometimes get
to try to solve unsolves problems, and I do it imperfectly but creatively.
<u>The English Major</u> creates stories no one has read before,
and Liam describes new insights into stories that few if any have seen before.
Another point that stands out and often rings true is that programs are meant
to be read by people. Now, this may seem like a similarity to my English major
friends, but very often literary writing is not meant to be read by anyone.
I'm sure someone has written code that is not meant to be read by man nor
machine, but that seems a bit pointless. I don't even know where I was going
with this, so I'll change topics here.

Or, maybe not. Graham (I ran out of ways to mess up his name) says code is
meant to be read by humans, but desires a programming language that lets him
scribble. He also doesn't seem to be a fan of static typing. I would argue that
scribbling is not meant to be read by humans (even yourself - I can't
scribble something and come back to it), and that static typing can be helpful
for reading what will actually happen. I think both points stem from the fact
that, while Graham says code is only incidentally meant to be understood
by a computer, the only reason anyone would ever read or write code is 
for running it on hardware. I don't care how the code reads, if it is impossible
to run on a machine, or even if it is just difficult to see how a machine would
run the program, the code is garbage.
I mean, I understand the sentiment, but it seems silly to be so idealistic -
a language that lets you smear is a poor one, ambiguity stands in direct
opposition to the idea that code is meant to be read by humans.

Oh. I guess I'll say this here, because I forgot to earlier - I think the term
"Computer Science" is a lie, as I don't believe the formal sciences are
actual science - they are philosophies or forms of mathematics. If your work
does not involve experimentation in order to discern the unchangeable laws
of the physical world, your work is not really science. Of course, words
only have meaning as far as they're used, and people use science to mean
the body of natural knowledge and all that jazz, so I guess it doesn't matter
what I think.

 I do love his line "It turns out that looking at things from other people's point of view is practically the secret of success."
 - I feel people could learn a lot from that, though it is often ignored.
I'd take it a step further and say you should respect other people's
points of view, even if you disagree. This is largely why I hate the media -
they not only disrespect opposing points of view, but encourage lack of
empathy towards, and even hatred of, opposing view points.
  
Graham describes hackers as makers, people who make things without
regard for scientific rigor or mathematical interest. He describes his
form of debugging on the fly, which seems very, very in-line with Levy's
depiction of the early hacker - Graham didn't want to solve problems out
on paper first until they were perfect (batch processing?) - he
wanted to do it live (interactive sessions). Graham describes
the desire to hack for 16 hours a day, which seems to share the sentiment
with Levy's description of early hackers who spent long, irregular hours
hacking away while also being less extreme than what the early hackers
had done. Graham does disagree with the early hackers on collaboration, though
- Graham says you should never paint over the work of another, while the
early hackers seemed happy to improve each other's code.

To answer that last question, I guess I do agree with Graham's modern
view of the hacker. Splitting projects like he describes seems efficient
and logical, and is how I usually do group work. Issues and merge requests
on GitHub often work that way, too. I agree with how he describes hacking
as a medium, and I do think it is far older than even the original
hackers Levy describes, as to me the idea of a hacker should not be limited
to the technology of the time. The hacker medium has grown in the last 14
years, and there are many beautiful things being created. I also agree
that publications and other metrics are a poor way to judge a hacker - 
I hate things like grades, school work, academia in general, the business world,
politics, and many other institutions that seek to measure value. 

To be honest, I am not sure that I answered the question at all. I guess
I don't know what a _type_ of person is. Are you saying people
are reducible to a single type? Is this type _static_? Seems awfully
close-minded of you.
