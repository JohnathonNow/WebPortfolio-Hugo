All of my friends are sad and want to drink, so I wanna make this quick.

We're watching cooking shows while I write this, just like the time we
watched cooking shows while dring to ND from PA going down the highway at 87
MPH. I guess I'll talk about the taboos first. [Tabuu](http://supersmashbros.wikia.com/wiki/Tabuu)
was the final boss to Super Smash Bros. Brawl's Subspace Emissary campaign.
Wait. I spelled taboo wrong? Oops.

In this history of Open Source, these taboos seem pretty well followed. There
are a couple of forks of big-name projects that split communities, but for the
most part projects aren't forked. I've been occasionally contributing to a
[python library for facebook's Messenger chat service](https://github.com/carpedm20/fbchat),
and someone in the community got upset with the speed at which merge requests
were reviewed and tried to fork the project - he even emailed me trying to get
me to join him. AFAIK, no one joined him and his heresy died off.

These three taboos vary a bit in Open Source friendliness in my opinion.
Forks should be done sparingly - it
is better for the community making progress on a project to work together
rather than having everyone work separately and litterally making fractions of 
the progress they would have been making. By having structure in a project, 
people can work on different things efficiently, and the project can be 
completed faster. All that being said, explicitly discouraging forking seems
a little against Open Source ideals - anyone should be able to hack anything,
but most people doesn't explicitly discourage it - rather, they encourage people
to contribute to existing projects, which is a fine thing to do.

 > Distributing changes to a project without the cooperation of the moderators is frowned upon.

This one is a bit strange to me. Distributing changes is very much like forking,
but this is the kind of thing that makes Open Source good - anyone can fix
something and distribute their fixes. In the MIT lab thing we were forced
against our will to read about, people just made patches to programs. There are
definitely cases where ignoring any moderators is a good idea - especially
with dead or abandoned projects. In general, however, it is probably best
to distribute any changes with *some* cooperation with the moderators, even
if it is just issuing a pull request as well as writing on whatever message
boards "hey I fixed the thing, look at it".

 > Removing a person's name from a project history, credits, or maintainer list is absolutely not done without the person's explicit consent.

Well, that's just being considerate.

We covered that two axis graph thingy in class, and it seems to be a fair
assessment of the types of people involved with Open Source software. 
I don't really care if people charge for things, so long as it's fair. 
I do demand things like server-sided code be shared - it is NOT acceptable
to release products that simply stop working in a few years. One of the
only peope I watch on the YouTubes (in fact, the only guy I watch on YouTube)
[reviews old games](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6PNZBb6b9Ltgl6WM5rn2pjrXd_qdit2S),
and he absolutely hates how video games just die off because the company
doesn't care enough to hand the code out to the community. So yeah, I agree
in part with ESR's assessment, and I agree with the FSF idealogy against
software hoarding (if I interpretted it correctly). 

I think the biggest drives for Open Source today are that people want
[jorbs](http://www.homestarrunner.com/cantsayjob.html), and showing code is
maybe a good way to get one? I don't know. Hacker News commenters tell me both,
and that confuses me. Another big drive is the desire to get something built.
Like, lots of people have ideas they want realized, and a good way to get
something built is to establish a good foundation and make it public. Once
you get the ball rolling, you might be able to pull a Linus and have an army
of people write your code for you. Then, a company will use your free stuff
and maybe decide to retroactively make you a millionaire.

I suppose I do find the idea of the gift economy and the role of reputation to
be somewhat interesting, maybe not appeealing. 
The gift economy idea is, um, neat?
I find it to be fairly true in practice - the best people in the community are 
the ones who
give the most to it - including what they give that allows others to give more.
Reputation is a bit weird to me. I do wish reputation played less of a role in
Open Source, as one problem I see with many communities is elitism. Throughout
the books we read, there was definitely a feeling of elitism, of the hacker
*elite*. I don't like elitism very much, and if there were no reputations to
uphold or to gain, perhaps there would be less elitism. 

I like writing code. That is good enough motivation to do most things. If I 
help someone do something that helps me, that's good. I don't need to be
incentivized further. Participation in Open Sorce should be driven by
desire to improve the state of the world - either by solving problems you face,
encouraging others to solve your problems, or by solvng the problems others
have. Any desire to gain reputation seems shallow and a bit evil.
